```bash
To run your Node.js application, you can use either of the following commands, depending on your setup:

1. **`node .`** - This command runs the Node.js application starting from the `index.js` file in the current directory (assuming `index.js` is the main file).

2. **`node index.js`** - This command directly specifies `index.js` as the file to run.

Both commands will start your Node.js application, so you can use either one based on your preference or specific setup.
```
